2	Exploring Potential Fraud in the Help to Buy Scheme	To identify whether there is potential fraud in the Help to Buy Scheme, relating to the overinflaton of income (fraud by misrepresentation) and the failure to declare existing property ownership at the point of application (fraud by omission).	This information sharing agreement will help Homes England to identify any fraud in the Help to Buy Scheme, and to qualify the nature of this fraud. In doing so, Homes England will be able to assess compliance and review policies for preventative purposes only.	information-sharing-agreement-powers-and-objectives-0001:7	Data on earnings and income, on self-assessment, on benefits and credits, and on property ownership will be disclosed by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to Homes England	government-organisation:D25	"Homes England"	Government Secure Email			P3M	2018-09-06	2019-03-31	2019-01-17	DPO@homesengland.gov.uk		
3	National Fraud Initiative - HMRC and Local Authority Counter Fraud Pilot	The National Fraud Initiative (NFI) is the Cabinet Office’s UK-wide data matching exercise. It is exploring the potential value and effectiveness of using HMRC data to better identify and prevent fraud. We will share records containing personal data with HMRC. These will be matched against HMRC records and additional HMRC information appended and fed back to the NFI to be evaluated as to how it may improve the NFI national exercise. 	The expected benefits are;   1. To provide additional intelligence on data matches already generated and released by the NFI for participant organisations to consider and investigate where appropriate; 2. To allow the NFI to update its fraud risk scoring of these released matches;  3. To assist with the reduction of potential false positive data match disclosure within the existing NFI data matching: and 4. To allow additional counter fraud data matches to be generated from just the additional HMRC results. 	information-sharing-agreement-powers-and-objectives-0001:7	Data items will relate to: ●Employed and self-employed earnings  ●Household composition ●Property ownership 	government-organisation:D2		Secure File Transfer (batch basis)	government-organisation:D25		P2Y	2018-12-01	2020-12-31	2019-12-01	nfiqueries@cabinetoffice.gov.uk		
4	Testing the feasibility of data matching  between VOA and DWP data for improved fuel poverty targeting	To test the matching of two data sets to enable Government to better identify households at risk of fuel poverty and improve the targeting of support to tackle fuel poverty 	The testing will help BEIS understand the feasibility of the matching between the two datasets, identify areas of error or non-match and investigate mitigations in order to maximise the datasets' matching success rates. The data matching mechanism would enable more effective targeting of fuel poverty policies.	information-sharing-agreement-powers-and-objecitves-0001:2	Valuation Office Agency (VOA) data relating to property characteristics will be shared with the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) for ranking according to potential energy costs.
